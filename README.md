# Extracting-named-entities-from-text
Hello!
In this program, words and specifications are stored, and you enter a text, for example, an email, and if the stored words are in the text, it will store those words in a set, and if there are no words, a placeholder text will show "not available". gives
An example text is also shown at the beginning of the program, which you can use to test the program!
I hope you like this program.
